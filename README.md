SVDfilterd data extract from PALA is stored in IQ folder.

If the IQ folder is empty, you should first download data and place it there.

The q1 required large memory and can run quiet a long time.

Change the parameter (pala_local = false;) in q2_q3 to decide whether pala localization data or localization data generated in q1.

Run q1 first to generate localization data that can be used in q2_q3.

Run q2_q3 first to generate matout that can be shown in q4.
